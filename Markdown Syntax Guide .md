# The Markdown elements outlined in the original design document

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed for easy formatting of plain text. It is widely used for creating simple and clean documents with a focus on readability and ease of use. Markdown documents can be easily converted into HTML, making them suitable for various purposes such as writing documentation, creating web pages, and composing emails

## Headers:- 
Markdown provides six levels of headers, indicated by the number of hash symbols (#). The more hash symbols, the smaller the heading.


| Name       |   | Markdown Syntax |
|------------|---|-----------------|
| Heading  1 | - | # Hariom        |
| Heading  2 | - | ## Hariom       |
| Heading  3 | - | ### Hariom      |
| Heading  4 | - | #### Hariom     |
| Heading  5 | - | ##### Hariom    |
| Heading  6 | - | ###### Hariom   |

## Paragraphs:- 
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

## Line Breaks 
To create a line break or new line <br>, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

You can use two or more spaces (commonly referred to as “trailing whitespace”) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application, but it’s controversial. It’s hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence. For this reason, you may want to use something other than trailing whitespace for line breaks. If your Markdown application you can use the **BR** HTML tag.

# Emphasis
You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

## Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

| Name         |   | Markdown Syntax                |
|--------------|---|--------------------------------|
| Bold type 1  | - | You just love ** code hariom **. |
| Bold type 2  | - | I just love __ bold text __.     |
| Bold type  3 | - | Love ** is ** bold               |

## Italic

To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters

| Name         |   | Markdown Syntax                |
|--------------|---|--------------------------------|
| Italic type 1  | - | You just love * code hariom *. |
| Italic type 2  | - | I just love _ bold text _.     |
| Italic type  3 | - | Love * is * bold               |


## Bold and Italic

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.
